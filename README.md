      //accessing today's date
      var today = new Date();
      var todayMonth = today.getMonth() + 1; 
      var todayDate = today.getDate();

      data.forEach(function(row, idx) {

          var firstName = row[0];
          var lastName = row[1];
          var email = row[2];

          var emailSubject = "Happy Birthday " + firstName + "!";

          var emailBody = template.evaluate().getContent();
          //sending the mail
          GmailApp.sendEmail(email, emailSubject, "", {name: "Email App", htmlBody: emailBody });
